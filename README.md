## About the Project

**KoBaChain** is not just another blockchain.  
It is a hypermodular, post-quantum, and AI-native network built for the future.

A network that scales by itself.  
A DAO that learns from failure.  
A token integrated into every module.  
Cryptography built to withstand 2030 and beyond.

Core innovations:
- **ALAS** — AI-based sharding that dynamically grows and contracts with load
- **NeuroPoS** — a consensus protocol that evaluates validators based on behavior and reputation
- **KoBaDNA** — zk-STARK-based ID and soulbound reputation with zero KYC
- **KoBaMind** — an AI-powered DAO where intelligence amplifies governance
- **PostQuantum Layer** — next-gen quantum-resistant security (Dilithium, Falcon)

## Architecture (Hypermodular Core)

```mermaid

  A[Hypermodular Layer] --> B1(KoBaDEX)
  A --> B2(AI Vaults)
  A --> B3(KoBaMind)
  A --> B4(ALAS Sharding)
  A --> B5(NeuroPoS)
  A --> B6(KoBaDNA ID)
  A --> B7(PostQuantum Layer)
  A --> B8(KoBaBridge)
```

Each module:
- Can be upgraded without hard forks
- Operates independently, but integrates via DAO and AI
- Adapts in real time to network load and user activity

## KBCH Token

**KBCH** is a multichain token (Arbitrum + BNB) embedded into every layer of KoBaChain:

- Powers governance via KoBaMind (AI DAO)
- Required as `gas` for all execution environments
- Used to launch modular subnets and smart modules
- Acts as a cryptographic anchor in zk-based identity (KoBaDNA)

📌 **Tokenomics, vesting, and DAO allocations will be released prior to TGE.**
